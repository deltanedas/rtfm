## Doc Syntax
Instructions are described as follows:
[royal]instruction name[] [stat]Type[] arg, ...
Arguments inherit the previous type if not specified.

Type may be:
	bool: true or false, 1 or 0
	int: number with no decimal
	double: number with optional decimal
	Unit: a unit in the world
	Building: a block in the world
	String: text enclosed in quotes ([coral]""[])
	Val: A variable name used as a generic or to hold a value.
	Sensable: An Item, Liquid or Building property.
		A full list is shown when the pencil button is pressed.
	Target: Trait to filter a unit or block by
	Op: Mathematical operation, unary or binary
	etc.
Types not specified here usually refer to the class name.

# Colours
The following colours have special meaning:
	[royal][[royal][]: Instruction name
	[violet][[violet][]: Sub-instruction name
	[coral][[coral][]: Hard-coded value or instruction parameter.
	[stat][[stat][]: Variable name, the variable it refers to holds the real value.
		In instruction definitions, not examples, it signifies a param type.

## Basics
In mindustry logic, instructions are executed from top to bottom, wrapping around at the end.
The first address (line) is 0, the largest is 999.

Values may be passed directly or from a variable, unless specified otherwise.
The following are equivalent:
	[royal]set[] [coral]egg[] [stat]"egg yum yum"[]
	[royal]print[] [stat]egg[]
and
	[royal]print[] [stat]"egg yum yum"[]

Sub-instructions can never be passed from a variable.

# Writing

Mindustry logic can be written in a text editor like assembly, or graphically in a logic block.

Examples of both:
[royal]draw[] [violet]clear[] [stat]0 0 0 0 0 0[]
[royal]drawflush[] [stat]display1[]
{rtfm-instruction-example}
(In this case the draw instruction has 6 values, [violet]clear[] only uses 3 so only 3 are shown)

# Measurements
All in-world instructions that take coordinates and/or radii take their units in [stat]tiles[].

# Links
Blocks linked to the processor can be gotten from
[royal]getlink[] [coral]block[] [stat]0[]
or
[royal]<blocksuffix>1[]
Where the latter is like Lua, it is 1-indexed.
Linked blocks show their associated variable when the processor is selected.

## Instructions

# Special block operations
These instructions are for memory cells, displays and message blocks respectively.

[royal]write[] [stat]double[] value, [stat]Building[] cell, [stat]int[] address
	Sets the [stat]double[] at [coral]address[] of [coral]cell[] to [coral]value[].
	Does nothing on blocks other than memory cells.

[royal]read[] [stat]Var[] store, [stat]Building[] cell, [stat]int[] address
	Reads the [stat]double[] from [coral]address[] of [coral]cell[] into variable [coral]store[].
	Does nothing on blocks other than memory cells.
	In English, reads the ([coral]address[] + 1)th number from the memory cell.

[royal]draw[]
	These sub-instructions queue operations that are run with [royal]drawflush[].

	[violet]clear[] [stat]int[] r, g, b
		Fills the display with a colour.

	[violet]color[] [stat]int[] r, g, b
		Sets the colour for future operations.

	[violet]stroke[] [stat]int[] width
		Sets line width for future [violet]*line[] operations.

	[violet]line[] [stat]int[] x1, y1, x2, y2
		Draw a line from one point to another.

	[violet]rect[] [stat]int[] x, y, w, h
		Draw a rectangle with bottom left corner [stat]x, y[] and top right corner [stat]x + w, y + h[].

	[violet]lineRect[] [stat]int[] x, y, w, h
		Like [violet]rect[] but with lines.

	[violet]poly[] [stat]int[] x, y, sides, [stat]double[] radius, rotation
		Draw an equilateral polygon centered on a point.
		A circle may be drawn with many sides.

	[violet]linePoly[] [stat]int[] x, y, sides, [stat] double[] radius, position
		Like [violet]poly[] but with lines.

	[violet]triangle[] [stat]int[] x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3
		Draw a triangle with 3 points.
		Has no [violet]line[] equivalent.

	[violet]image[] [stat]int[] x, y, [stat]UnlockableContent[] image, [stat]double[] size, rotation
		Draws [coral]image[][green].icon(Cicon.medium)[] centered on the position.
		You can use any subclass of UC, e.g. Item, UnitType, Block, etc.

[royal]drawflush[] [stat]Building[] display
	Flush all pending [royal]draw[] operations to a display.
	They are drawn on the next tick.


[royal]print[] [stat]String[] text
	Add [stat]text[] to the processor's print buffer.
	UnlockableContent is serialized by getting its [stat]name[] field, e.g. [stat]routorio-solar-router[].
	Building does the same but for its [stat]block.name[].
	Unit does the same but for its [stat]type.name[].

[royal]printflush[] [stat]Building[] msgblock
	Set [stat]msgblock[]'s text to the processor's print buffer.

# General operations
These instructions are used by almost every program.

[royal]getlink[] [stat]Var[] store, [stat]int[] index
	Gets linked tile #[coral]index[] and puts it in [coral]store[].
	Can be used for things like iterating over all linked blocks.
	Can be iterated over null-termination (C string) style or for-loop style with [royal]@links[].

[royal]control[]
	[violet]enabled[] [stat]Building[] target, [stat]bool[] enabled
		Enable a block like a conveyor, switch, door, etc.
		Doesn't work for:
			- Lunchpads
			- Power nodes [stat](Use diodes instead)[]
			- [stat]@this[] since technically it isn't linked.

		[coral]Also note that buildings which do not get disabled regularly will automatically re-enable themselves after a while.[]

	[violet]shoot[] [stat]Building[] turret, [stat]double[] x, y, [stat]bool[] shoot
		Tell the turret to fire at an absolute position.
		If [stat]shoot[] is false it will cease firing.

	[violet]shootp[] [stat]Building[] turret, [stat]Healthc[] target, [stat]bool[] shoot
		Smart version of [violet]shoot[], gets the predicted position of a block or unit.
		Takes speed and position into account, giving a decent guess as to where the target will be.
		A typical idiom is [violet]shootp[] [stat]turret target target[], to shoot at a target if it exists.

	[violet]configure[] [stat]Building[] build. [stat]Content[] config
		Sets certain blocks' configuration to [coral]config[].
		Only works with blocks that accept [stat]UnitType[], [stat]Item[] or [stat]Liquid[]s,
		 such as sorters, unloaders, item/liquid sources, unit factories, etc.

	[violet]color[] [stat]Buildig[] illuminator, [stat]double[] r, g, b
		Sets the color of the illuminators. Colors needs to be doubles in the range from 0 (no color) to 1 (full color).

[royal]radar[] [stat]Ranged[] turret, [stat]TargetType[] prop1, prop2, prop3, [stat]bool[] order, [stat]Val[] output
	Radar gets a list of units targetable by a unit, turret, mender, overdrive/force projector or processor.
	[coral]Prop1-3[] are different properties that a target must have to be valid.
	For example, [coral]player any any[] will match any player target,
		but [coral]player block any[] will only match player blocks
		and [coral]any any any[] matches any block or unit at all.
	(Player refers to this turret's team)
	If order is false, the list of targets is in reverse order.

	The next target is put in [coral]output[].
	The target can be a [stat]Unit[] or [stat]Building[], internally it is [stat]Healthc[].

[royal]sensor[] [stat]Val[] store, [stat]Building[] block, [stat]Sensable[] sense
	Extract information [stat]sense[] from [stat]block[], saved to [stat]store[].
	For example, to get the amount of graphite in a block:
		[royal]sensor[] [coral]graphcount[] [stat]block @graphite[]
	Use the number in [stat]graphcount[] afterwards.

[royal]set[] [stat]Val[] varname, [stat]Val[] value
	Set a variable with name [stat]varname[] to [stat]value[].
	For example, to copy [stat]@this[] into [coral]block[]:
		[royal]set[] [coral]block[] [stat]@this[]

[royal]op[] [stat]Op[] op, [stat]Val[] result, [stat]double[] a, [[b]
	Set [stat]result[] to the output of a mathematical operation.
	If [coral]b[] is not set then it is ignored for a unary operation.
	Some operations of note:
		[royal]op[] [violet]rand[] [coral]num[] [stat]10[]
			Returns a random double between [0, 10).
			To get rand(min, max), subtract the min from max to use with rand then add min to the result.
		[royal]op[] [violet]floor[] [coral]num[] [stat]1.9999[]
			Rounds a number [stat]down[] to a whole number, essentially num = num // 1.
			To round a number to the [stat]nearest[], add 0.5 then floor.

# Control flow

[royal]end[]
	Shorthand for [royal]jump[] [stat]0[] [violet]always[].

[royal]jump[] [stat]int[] addr, [stat]Comp[] comp, [stat]Val[] a, b
	Jumps to [coral]addr[] if a condition is met.
	Can be used on its own as an [stat]if[] statement, or with other instructions to form while, for, switch statements, or even functions.
	The address does not change in the graphical editor, it is tied to a statement.
	[royal]jump[] [stat]addr[] [violet]always[] is the jump equivalent to [royal]set[] [coral]@counter[] [stst]addr[].
	[red]You cannot use a variable for addr, @counter must be used for variable jumps.[]

	Control flow visualised with condition not met and met respectively:
	{rtfm-jump}

# Units
These instructions work on the [stat]@unit[] register, rather than parameters like [royal]control[] would.
This is mainly to prevent controlling enemy units found from [royal]radar[].

[royal]ubind[]
	[stat]UnitType[] type
		Loads the next cached unit of a certain [stat]type[] into [coral]@unit[].
		It will loop over them round-robin style, it will loop over once it reaches the last unit.
		Other unit instructions use the unit in [stat]@unit[].
		Won't work across teams.
		[coral]Has no range limit.[]

		Examples of unit types:
			[stat]@mono
			@routorio-sexy-router
			@poly[]

	[stat]Unit[] unit
		Binds an existing unit from a variable, e.g. from [royal]radar[].
		Obviously can't be used on enemy units.

[royal]ucontrol[]
	Act on [stat]@unit[].
	Subinstructions that take positions (besides [violet]move[]/[violet]approach[]) [red]will not move the unit[], you must do that yourself.
	No-op for player-controlled units.

	[violet]idle[]
		Don't move but keep building/mining. The default state.

	[violet]stop[]
		Stop all actions, including shooting.
		To stop and stay shooting, move to the current position with [royal]sensor[]'d @x and @y.

	[violet]move[] [stat]double[] x, y
		Move to a position on the map.

	[violet]approach[] [stat]double[] x, y, radius
		Like [violet]move[], but will stop moving if within [coral]radius[] tiles of the center.
		Causes units to spread out around a position.
		{rtfm-ucontrol-approach}

	[violet]boost[] [stat]bool[] enable
		Enable or disable boosting for mechs.

	[violet]pathfind[]
		Make the unit follow standard AI; find enemy cores, guard spawns, obey command centers.

	[violet]target[] [stat]double[] x, y, [stat]bool[] shoot
		[royal]control[] [violet]shoot[] but for units.
		[red]Will not shoot outside of the unit's range![]
		To counter this, clamp a position to inside its range:
			[purple]# Deconstruct the shoot position into a right-triangle relative to the unit[]
			[royal]op[] [violet]sub[] [coral]dx[] [stat]shootX x[]
			[royal]op[] [violet]sub[] [coral]dy[] [stat]shootY y[]
			[royal]op[] [violet]atan2[] [coral]angle[] [stat]dx dy[]
			[royal]op[] [violet]dst[] [coral]dist[] [stat]dx dy[]
			[purple]# Clamp it within "range"[]
			[royal]op[] [violet]min[] [coral]dist[] [stat]dist range[]
			[purple]# Reconstruct the clamped shoot position[]
			[royal]op[] [violet]sin[] [coral]dy[] [stat]angle[]
			[royal]op[] [violet]cos[] [coral]dx[] [stat]angle[]
			[royal]op[] [violet]mul[] [coral]dy[] [stat]dy dist[]
			[royal]op[] [violet]mul[] [coral]dx[] [stat]dx dist[]
			[royal]op[] [violet]add[] [coral]shootX[] [stat]x dx[]
			[royal]op[] [violet]add[] [coral]shootY[] [stat]y dy[]
			[purple]# Shoot to the clamped position[]
			[royal]ucontrol[] [violet]target[] [stat]x y true[]

	[violet]targetp[] [stat]Healthc[] target, [stat]bool[] shoot
		[royal]control[] [violet]shootp[] but for units.

	[violet]itemDrop[] [stat]Building[] to, [stat]int[] amount
		Drops at most [coral]amount[] items into a building.

	[violet]itemTake[] [stat]Building[] from, [stat]Item[] item, [stat]int[] amount
		Takes at most [coral]amount[] of an [coral]item[] from a building.

	[violet]payDrop[]
		Drops the current payload, if there's room (for blocks).

	[violet]payTake[] [stat]bool[] takeUnits
		Picks up a block, or unit [coral](takeUnits = true)[], if there's one underneath the unit.
		Only works for units like Mega and Oct that can carry payloads.

	[violet]mine[] [stat]double[] x, y
		Mine the ore at the position.
		Does nothing if it's not minable or already being mined.

	[violet]flag[] [stat]double[] flag
		Sets the unit's flag to a number.
		Read it back with [royal]sensor[] [coral]flagVar[] [stat]@unit @flag[].
		Use to identify certain units.
		Seen as the number next to the gear when hovering over a unit.

	[violet]build[] [stat]double[] x, y, [stat]Block[] block, [stat]0 <= int < 4[] rotation, [stat]Var[] config
		Build a block at a certain position, in tiles.
		Block is in the form [stat]@[][pink]<id>[].
		Config is currently limited to items with Sorter, Unloader and * Sources
		Examples of blocks:
			[stat]@router
			@routorio-double-router
			@cryofluid-mixer[]

	[violet]getBlock[] [stat]double[] x, y, [stat]Block[] type, [stat]Building[] building
		Get the [stat]Building[] at a position and put it in [coral]building[], its [stat]Block[] type in [coral]type[].
		[coral]Type[] can be used with [violet]build[].
		When [coral]type[] or [coral]building[] is printed, it will serialize as just the block's name.

	[violet]within[] [stat]double[] x, y, radius, [stat]bool[] result
		Sets result to whether a unit is in the specified circle.

		Here, the [green]circle[] is at [red]x[], [red]y[] and has the specified [blue]radius[].
		Since the bound [stat]@unit[] is within the circle, [coral]result[] is set to true.
		{rtfm-ucontrol-within}

[royal]uradar[] [stat]Target[] a, b, c, [stat]SortType[] sort, [stat]bool[] 0, [stat]bool[] order, [stat]Healthc[] result
	Like [royal]radar[], but on all units in the unit register.
	Searches until a suitable target is found.
	0 is only part of the text instruction and not included graphically in the logic block. It has no meaning.

[royal]ulocate[]
	Uses units to find a block type.
	Meant to be used to find blocks that are out of range for the unit.
	[coral]outFound[] is only set to true if [coral]outX[] and [coral]outY[] point to the desired block.
	[red]Cannot locate specific block types, only general categories.[]

	[violet]ore[] [stat]Item[] ore, [stat]double[] outX, outY, [stat]bool[] outFound
		Looks for an ore with an itemDrop of [coral]ore[].
		Use [stat]@sand[] to find sand/dark sand, [stat]@copper[] to find copper, etc.

	[violet]building[] [stat]BlockFlag[] type, [stat]bool[] enemy, [stat]double[] outX, outY, [stat]bool[] outFound, [stat]Building[] outBuilding
		Looks for a building with certain pathfinder block flags.
		If [coral]enemy[] is true, derelict blocks cannot be located.
		If [coral]outFound[] is set to true and the block is on the processor's team, [coral]outBuilding[] is set to the block found.
		[stat]If you do operations that need [coral]outBuilding[], ignore [coral]outFound[] as it may not always be defined.[]

	[violet]spawn[] [stat]double[] outX, outY, [stat]bool[] outFound
		Find an enemy spawn.

[royal]noop[]
	Does absolutely nothing.
	Use to sleep for a cycle, each processor supports more cycles per tick.
	Fallback instruction if parsing fails.
	Graphically represented by the [stat]Invalid[] block.
