# Setup
Get [coral]sample.js[] from your RTFM zip/folder or from GitHub at
	[stat]https://github.com/DeltaNedas/rtfm/raw/6.0/sample.js[]
Modify it to suit your needs, read the comments

# Adding pages
Use [green]rtfm.addPage("cool manpage")[] to add a page.
This loads the text from [green]manuals/cool manpage[] in your mod.
Multiple pages can be added at once with [stat]rtfm.addPages[].
Manual pages use a format documented in the [red]Format[] page.

# Sections
Sections are like pages but instead of containing a page's content, they show other pages.
Use [green]rtfm.addSection("OP Walls", [["Router Wall"])[] to add a section.
Sub-sections can be added with an [stat]object[] of [green]{"Section Name": [["Subpages"]}[] instead of a page name.
To add a page and subsection, set the page's value to null:
		[green]{
		"Section name": [["Pages..."],
		"Normal page": null
	}[]

# Translation
Manual pages can be translated with bundles.
Use [green]$[] at the start of a name to do so.
RTFM will try to find Translated -> English -> Untranslated ([green]$bundlekey[])

[green]rtfm.addPage("$translated")[] -> Translato -> Translated -> $translated
[green]rtfm.addSection("$anuke", [["$cat"])[] -> Anuko/Cato -> Anuke/Cat -> $anuke/$cat

Translated pages are referred to in code with the bundle key.
[green]rtfm.pages[["$anuke"][], not [red]rtfm.pages.Anuke[]

You can translate sections in two ways:
- In The folder only:
	Section Name/English
	Section Name/Español

- By keeping translations in their own folders:
	Section Name/English
	<Insert poor spanish>/Español

Use whichever you like, the latter is prefered as it is cleaner with more translations.
