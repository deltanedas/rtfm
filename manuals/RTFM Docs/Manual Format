# Headings
Headings start with [coral]#[] and are [stat][[stat][] by default, with an underline.
Unlike markdown, heading size is proportional to number of [coral]#[]es, not inversely.
Heading text size is the square root of the heading depth.
########### big heading :D

# Centering
~Lines can be centered with a [coral]tilde (~)[] at the start.

# Images
You can add images with [coral]{texture[[:size]}[].
The size is the image's height by default, width is scaled with it.
[stat]Prefix your mod's textures with modname-, as always.[]
If you ever need to escape a set of {[red][]curly brackets}, add symbols that arent :-_ inside.
Example:
	{rtfm-image-example}

# Inline scripts
Inline scripts are created with [green]$[green]("my\n#text\n{[]here}")[].
You may omit [green]return[] for a simple one-statement script.
The return value, if any, replaces the page's content and is parsed with it.
Acts like <? echo("ret") ?> in PHP.
You can manipulate the Table [coral]table[] if you want to add custom elements.
They can be escaped with colours like with images.
[red]Currently the parser will stop at the first unbalanced [green])[] it finds, you cannot include these in strings, use the escape sequence [green]\x29[] instead.[]
$("Example 1:")
	$[red][]("Example 1:")
Example 2:
	$[red][](const arr = [1, 2, 3]; return "#" + arr.join("\t\n"))
	$(const arr = [1, 2, 3]; return "#" + arr.join("\t\n"))

[stat]A challenge: try to make a manpage that infinitely parses itself.[]

# Text
Unformatted text is simply added as labels to the page's table.
You can use colours as usual with [coral][[][].
Colours will bleed onto the next line, so [red]make sure
 to cap them off with [[][]

Pages read from files have tabs replaced with 4 spaces, to save on disk space.
